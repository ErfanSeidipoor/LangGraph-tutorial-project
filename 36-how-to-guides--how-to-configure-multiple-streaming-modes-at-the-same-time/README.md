# LangGraphJS > How-to Guides > How to stream LLM tokens from your graph

This project is based on the [How to stream LLM tokens from your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/stream-tokens/)

In this example, we will stream tokens from the language model powering an agent. We will use a ReAct agent as an example.

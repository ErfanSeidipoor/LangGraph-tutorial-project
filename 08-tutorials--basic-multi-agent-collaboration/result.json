  "There are three main types of agent memory:\n\n1. Working memory: a temporary storage for information used in the current interaction.\n2. Memory stream: a long-term database storing an agent's comprehensive list of experiences.\n3. Reflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences to guide future behavior.\n\nI don't know how these types specifically interact or function together, but this gives general overview of each.",
